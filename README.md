## Hi I'm Yashraj! üëã
<br/>

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast and lifelong learner who loves solving real-world problems with code. From building intelligent AI systems to designing full-stack applications, I thrive on crafting practical solutions with a creative mindset.

<br/>

üéì I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Engineering at N K Orchid College Of Engineering & Technology**, where I‚Äôm exploring the depths of **AI, Full Stack Web Development, and Software Engineering**.

Through hands-on experience in **Machine Learning**, **Backend Development**, and **Computer Vision**, I‚Äôve developed a strong passion for creating impactful, scalable solutions. I'm especially interested in the intersection of **AI and systems design**, and how we can use technology to drive innovation.
